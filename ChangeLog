4.14:
----
    Fixed (4.06) markup and sets (4.06 listentries) to be optional (selectbox default), due to errors
    Rebuild the stylesheets
    Fixed various minor markup and logical code errors
    Fixed backend_templates/default_staticpage_backend.tpl smarty markup (escape and cke-wysiwyg)
    Changed template names to 'Default Template' (previously named 'Simple Template', which was not correct)
    and 'No Template' (previously named 'All Fields', which was not correct, since just the very old hardcoded form)
    Added 'publishstatus' and removed 'pass','is_startpage','is_404_page' in plugins config options,
         since the latter were unused there and are too specific to be set global in plugin config.
         Now 'publishstatus' will respect a global show as option rule (Draft is default)
    Outsourced some heavy hardcoded markup functions
    Smartified the backend as much as possible (get ready to run smarty-only in future?)
    Extend required Serendipity version to 1.6, since heavy smarty usage
    Rebuild the plugin stylesheets to work well with upcoming Serendipity 2.0
    Added a new responsive (mobile) template (build to work with upcoming Serendipity 2.0)
    Applied some plain button changes for 2.0 previously bumped as 4.06
    Added last_modified or created_on date option for frontend footer in plugin_staticpage.tpl (needs to change templates with already supplied files!)

4.06 Bump version since merged entry list pull request by (ogerlach)

4.05 Bump version to propagate changed plugin_staticpage_related_category.tpl

4.04 Bump version to propagate new .htaccess

4.00 rewrote document.write replacement (81e9911) to be more html standard conform

3.98  Changed custom <title>, meta description, and meta keywords to be regular fields, 
      not custom properties. 

3.97: Changed breadcrumb navigation so it is an independent option.  Templates that use custom
      static page templates (plugin_staticpage.tpl, plugin_staticpage_aboutpage.tpl, 
      plugin_staticpage_related.tpl) must be modified to include the condition
      {if $staticpage_show_breadcrumb}...{/if}.  See included plugin_staticpage.tpl
      for example.

3.72:
-----------------------------
Fix for not being able to edit a staticpage through the frontend's
Edit link


3.70, 3.71:
-----------------------------

Major new functionalities:

    1. Allow to create custom smarty templates used for editing a
       staticpage.
       
       When editing a staticpage in the backend, you now have a dropdown
       where you can choose a template. The default file is placed
       in the plugin's subdirectory "backend_templates". You can
       add files there on your own, which are then shown in the
       dropdown as well.
       
       You can override the content of those files within your
       template directory, by placing a file named exactly the same way,
       in the "backend_templates" sub-directory of your template. 
       Thus, you can put an empty file inside your plugin
       directory to initialize the ability to use a template-preference.
       
       The default template file has several smarty functions to query
       the current value and input fields. You can place all input
       fields the way you like, using Smarty/HTML layouts.
       
       You can also still switch to the "old way" through the dropdown.
       

    2. Introduce "custom properties" for staticpages.
    
        You need to add those custom properties to your custom smarty
        template, by accessing an input field "serendipity[plugin][custom][xxx]".
        The default backend template has a commented section for an
        example on how to use this.
        
        In your final smarty templates (either the staticpage_*.tpl files, or your
        usual smarty template files) you can access those custom properties through
        
        {$staticpage_custom.XXX}
        
        to place them anywhere you want.

To properly see the new layout, you might need to flush your browser's
CSS cache, as changes have been made to the plugin's CSS file.


3.61:
-----------------------------
Speed up call for getting staticpage list and cache it. Otherwise, the
plugin was unusable for thousands of staticpages, because the 
walkrecursive() function is VERY expensive.
